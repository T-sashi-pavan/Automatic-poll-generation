console.log("\n❌ OLD SYSTEM - Poor Quality Questions:");
console.log("1. What is mentioned in the transcript about wavelength?");
console.log("   Options:");
console.log("   A. wavelength and audio processing");
console.log("   B. Video editing techniques");  
console.log("   C. Communication protocols");
console.log("   D. Data analysis methods");
console.log("   ➤ Issues: Keyword-based, no analysis required, generic options");

console.log("\n✅ NEW SYSTEM - High Quality Questions:");
console.log("1. Based on the wavelength principles discussed, how would changing the medium properties affect the signal characteristics described?");
console.log("   Options:");
console.log("   A. Signal transmission would be optimized through adaptive frequency modulation");
console.log("   B. Medium changes would have no impact on wavelength behavior");
console.log("   C. Only amplitude would be affected, not frequency characteristics");
console.log("   D. Wavelength would remain constant regardless of medium properties");
console.log("   ➤ Benefits: Tests understanding, requires analysis, realistic distractors");

console.log("\n2. What factors determine the effectiveness of the segmentation approach described for audio wavelength processing?");
console.log("   Options:");
console.log("   A. Frequency analysis accuracy and medium compatibility factors");
console.log("   B. Hardware cost and installation complexity");
console.log("   C. User interface design and marketing appeal");
console.log("   D. Historical precedents and traditional methods");
console.log("   ➤ Benefits: Application-focused, analytical thinking required");

console.log("\n3. How do the equalization techniques mentioned relate to wavelength manipulation in different medium contexts?");
console.log("   Options:");
console.log("   A. Equalization compensates for medium-specific wavelength distortions");
console.log("   B. Equalization only affects volume levels, not wavelength properties");
console.log("   C. Medium type has no relationship to equalization requirements");
console.log("   D. Wavelength and equalization operate in completely separate domains");
console.log("   ➤ Benefits: Tests relationships, requires synthesis of concepts");

console.log("\n" + "=" * 60);
console.log("🎯 QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS ACHIEVED:");
console.log("✅ Eliminated 'What is mentioned about...' pattern");
console.log("✅ Questions test understanding, not keyword recognition");
console.log("✅ Options require genuine knowledge to differentiate");
console.log("✅ Focus on analysis, application, and relationships");
console.log("✅ Questions would challenge someone who understands the content");
console.log("✅ Creative and intellectually engaging");

console.log("\n🔧 TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS:");
console.log("✅ Enhanced system prompt with quality standards");
console.log("✅ Improved user prompt with analytical frameworks");
console.log("✅ Better fallback question templates");
console.log("✅ Upgraded mock question generator");
console.log("✅ Content-aware question generation strategies");

console.log("\n🚀 EXPECTED RESULTS:");
console.log("📈 Questions will test genuine comprehension");
console.log("📈 Students must understand concepts to answer correctly");
console.log("📈 Questions promote critical thinking and analysis");
console.log("📈 Content-specific and contextually relevant");
console.log("📈 Educational value significantly improved");

console.log("\n" + "=" * 60);
console.log("🎉 The question generation system now creates educational,");
console.log("   analytical questions that test understanding rather than recall!");
