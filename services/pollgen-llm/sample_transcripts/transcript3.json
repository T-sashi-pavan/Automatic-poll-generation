  "text": "Welcome back, students! Last time we explored the concept of derivatives — today, let’s see how they are applied, and then begin discussing integration.\n\nOne major application of derivatives is **optimization**. For example, in business, companies often want to maximize profit or minimize cost. \nBy taking the derivative of a cost or profit function and setting it equal to zero, we can find critical points. \nThen, using the second derivative test, we can determine whether these points are minima or maxima.\n\nAnother important use is in **motion problems**. If a particle’s position is given by a function s(t), then the first derivative, s'(t), gives its velocity, and the second derivative, s''(t), gives its acceleration. \nThis helps us model real-world dynamics in physics and engineering.\n\nNow, let’s begin our discussion on **integration**, which is often viewed as the reverse of differentiation.\nWhile derivatives measure the rate of change, integrals measure the accumulation of quantities. \nThe **definite integral** of a function over an interval [a, b] gives the area under the curve between those two points.\n\nThis leads us to the **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**, which connects differentiation and integration. \nIt states that if F is the antiderivative of f, then the definite integral of f from a to b is F(b) - F(a).\n\nLet’s take an example: If f(x) = 2x, then an antiderivative is F(x) = x². So, the integral of 2x from 1 to 3 is F(3) - F(1) = 9 - 1 = 8.\n\nWe’ll explore both definite and indefinite integrals in more detail. We’ll also learn techniques like substitution and integration by parts, which help us solve more complex integrals.\n\nIn summary, calculus allows us to move between rates of change and accumulation — providing the foundation for many modern technologies.\n\nIn our next class, we’ll practice solving real-world problems using both derivatives and integrals. Make sure you review the basic rules of differentiation and familiarize yourself with the integral notation.\n\nThat’s all for today. Great job, and see you in the next session!",
