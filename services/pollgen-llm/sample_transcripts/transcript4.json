  "text": "Good afternoon students. Today, we’re going to start our discussion on Database Management Systems, commonly referred to as DBMS. \nA DBMS is software that interacts with users, applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze data. \nIt enables data to be stored in an organized manner, allowing efficient retrieval, insertion, deletion, and updating.\n\nAt its core, a database is simply a collection of related data. Unlike traditional file systems, which store data in flat files, a DBMS offers structured storage using tables, rows, and columns, making data access faster and more reliable.\n\nThere are different types of DBMS such as Hierarchical, Network, Relational, and Object-Oriented DBMS. The most widely used is the Relational DBMS (RDBMS), which stores data in the form of tables, and uses Structured Query Language (SQL) for managing the data.\n\nLet’s dive deeper into the components and functionalities of a DBMS.",
