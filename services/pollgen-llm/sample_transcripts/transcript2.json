  "text": "Good morning students, today we’ll begin our journey into the world of calculus, starting with the concept of derivatives.\n\nDerivatives represent the rate at which a quantity changes. In simple terms, the derivative of a function at a point tells us the slope of the tangent line to the curve at that point. \nThis is fundamental in understanding how functions behave — especially in physics, engineering, and economics.\n\nLet’s take a function f(x) = x². If we compute its derivative, denoted as f'(x), we get 2x. \nThis means that at x = 1, the slope of the tangent line is 2, and at x = 3, it’s 6 — indicating how steep the curve is at those points.\n\nNow, how do we derive this derivative? We use the definition of the derivative:\n  f'(x) = lim(h → 0) [f(x + h) - f(x)] / h\nThis is called the difference quotient. \nIt captures how the function changes over a very small interval, eventually giving us the instantaneous rate of change.\n\nThere are basic rules of differentiation, like:\n- The power rule: d/dx [xⁿ] = n * xⁿ⁻¹\n- The sum rule: d/dx [f(x) + g(x)] = f'(x) + g'(x)\n- The product rule and quotient rule\n- The chain rule, useful for composite functions\n\nLet’s also touch on the geometric interpretation. \nIf you graph a curve and draw a tangent line at a point, the derivative at that point is the slope of this line. \nSo, in physics, if a graph represents distance over time, the derivative is velocity.\n\nDerivatives are widely used: to find maxima and minima (optimization problems), in motion analysis, in business to determine marginal cost and revenue, and much more.\n\nThat’s it for today’s session. In our next class, we’ll explore the applications of derivatives and then move into integration — the other half of calculus.\n\nThank you and see you next time!",
